# quarto-plots

Plotting and Charts created in Quarto.

The first plot was created on 2022-06-10. This is a ggplot bar chart located in Docs folder : *00-BarPlot-ErrorBars.qmd*. This plot follows a tutorial posted on YouTube by Rejendra Choure. Link to the YouTube tutorial is in the qmd document. This plot example includes a really nice way of creating themes and optional color palettes using *library(pubr)* and *library(ggsci)* to deploy optional themes and color palettes for your ggplots.

*01-Ordering-BarPlots.qmd*\* created on 2022-06-11 provides an example of using *reorder()* to change the order of your catagorical variables by reordering on a numerical variable.
